* A BIG THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING GREAT PEOPLE

- Koen Claessen and John Hughes for creating QuickCheck
  for the Haskell programming language and providing the
  inspiration for LectroCheck

- Jacob Matthews for his constant Scheming (hee, hee)
  and for his excellent suggestions

- Casey West, Chris Winters, Dan Wright, and the rest of the
  Pittsburgh Perl Mongers for continuing support, suggestions, and
  abundant, all-around coolness

- Andy Lester for prodding me into getting the word out and writing
  something about LectroTest

- Steffen Müller for good ideas about testing corner cases, which
  became the basis for LectroTests's failure recording and playback
  capabilities
